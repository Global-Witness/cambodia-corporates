          <h3>Searching for names</h3>
          <p>
            You can search for names by requesting an exact match or part of a name, but probably the most interesting feature is the fuzzy search. With the fuzzy search you can yield results that match the character string you input in the search field including all strings that allow for your chosen threshold of character differences. For example, searching for Seng Bopha with a 2 characters difference threshold, will also return Heng Bopha, Seng Sopha and Seng Sokha.<br />

          <h3>Resolutions</h3>
          <p>
            A resolution is the formal means by which decisions are made by a meeting of company members. In the context of this database, resolutions show the detailed set of amendments applied to a companyâ€™s registration information. It is the description of what exactly is being amended. For example, a company can amend its address, its nationality, change shareholders or directors etc.
